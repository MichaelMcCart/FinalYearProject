# Virtual Reality Carnival
Teeside University Final Year Project in BSc Computer Games Programming

This project is my FYP for teeside university. I made an immersive VR Carnival with mini games inside. I was holted by my own ability to create assets so everything is low poly but using sounds, shaders and a Virtual Reality Toolkit I feel my project speaks for itself scoring me a place on Teesides own ExpoTees to show my work to the industry.
